Worker can do:

DES brute force attack (1 block - 8 bytes data and 8 bytes key)

crypt brute force
- dictionary?

Lucene index of shakespears works
- single instance downloads from source and everyone else gets from him
- a bunch of nodes spin up, index the source, and answer queries
- another bunch of nodes ask questions
- membership of askers/answers is in the chat room

Monitoring node
(I decide I'm going to nagios/cacti/etc)

Jabber node
- leaves a message on server for the server:port of new server
